# Dart CLI Quiz App

This is a simple command-line quiz application built using Dart. The project was designed to reinforce core Dart programming concepts through a practical and interactive console-based application.

## Features

- Presents multiple-choice questions to the user
- Accepts user input through the terminal
- Tracks and displays the final score
- Uses List and Map for structured question management
- Implements control flow with loops and conditional statements

## What I Did

- Designed a quiz with a minimum of five questions
- Structured the quiz data using a List of Maps
- Created logic to validate user input and calculate scores
- Built a complete CLI application using Dart
- Ran and tested the application in a Dart environment

## What I Learned

- Declaring and using variables (`var`, `final`, `const`)
- Understanding and applying built-in data types like `int`, `String`, `List`, `Map`, and `bool`
- Writing and calling functions with named and optional parameters
- Using control flow statements including `if`, `for`, and `while`
- Implementing null-aware operators like `??` and `??=`
- Capturing and handling user input via the command line using `stdin`
